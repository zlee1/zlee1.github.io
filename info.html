      <h1>Wordle-N Info</h1>
      <p>
        This game is a lot like the original <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html">Wordle</a> game.
        <br>
        The only real difference here is that words can be sizes different than 5 and the number of guesses can be different than 6. 
        <br>
        Wordle-N allows for words ranging from 2 to 22 characters long!
      </p>

            This Wordle variation has fairly straightforward rules and they are as follows:

            <ul>
              <li>Enter a word by either typing or pressing buttons on the built-in keyboard,</li>
              <li>Ensure that your guess is a legal word (legal words came from extended scrabble list),</li>
              <li>Submit a guess, press the Enter key or the Guess button on the built-in keyboard,</li>
              <li>When a guess is submitted, you will receive information on your guess,</li>
              <ul style="list-style-type:circle">
                <li>A green cell means the letter is correct and in the correct position,</li>
                <li>A yellow cell means the letter is in the word but in the wrong position,</li>
                <li>A gray cell means the letter is not in the word.
              </ul>
            </ul>
